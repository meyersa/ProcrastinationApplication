## To-do
- **Setup backend Unix TIME alert system** - Take a map<Integer, Event> input and create timers
- Stuff on OneNote, quite a bit left

## Abstract - Future Plan
- UI Showing manager for multiple UIs to be open 
	- Can the other UIs just quit the main One? 
	- if not, could animate between them
- Move some of the classes out of MainGUI
	- Or perhaps make a scene manager, and have MainGUI just draw that and call classes inside of MainGUI
	- CreateEvent Anchor stuff outside of MainGUI class though
- With new Event manager
	- Add back preferences MenuItem/Create Preferences Menu
		- Num of events to display? 
		- Default Size? 
		- Where to store default events? 
		- Etc
	- Re-enable Fatal Error Menu
- Time Input Calender instead of UNIX Time
	- Input Time/Date then convert to UNIX Time?
